						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						My karate club asked me if i wanted to make a website for them. This is something i was
						interested in since i had the time and it seemed like good experience. I worked closely with the
						PR team on what they wanted the website to be. And regularly asked feedback and shared my work.
						This website now is an information source for all existing members and a way for the club to
						gain new members.
						<h2>My focus for this project</h2>
						The website of the closest club was quite primitive, old and cluttered, so i focused on making
						our site clear to use. I also wanted it to look good on all sorts of devices and since there was
						a competing club, SEO was also a factor. I am now mostly focused on maintaining the website like
						adding information on upcoming events and updating the outdated pictures.
