							<h2>Project Overview</h2>
							Go Apply Yourself was created in a team of four for the HVA with the assignment of making a
							bullet hell or bullet heaven. As a team we decided on taking inspiration from "enter the
							gungeon" and so we decided to make a roguelike dungeon crawler.
							<h2>My focus for this project</h2>
							In the team I became responsible for creating the roguelike dungeon. I created a level
							generation based on rooms. The difficulty came in that we agreed that evenly spaced square
							rooms were boring. So I had to create a system that could handle rooms with variable size,
							shape and door positions. I started this design off with creating a
							<a href="Images/LevelGeneration-UML.png" style="color: blueviolet" target="_blank"
								><u>UML</u></a
							>
							for the whole system. The sideQuest missions were scrapped but the rest was implemented
							following the UML. I decided to make a complicated wall hitbox optimization algorithm
							instead of checking surrounding tiles to set an algorithmic challenge for myself since
							algorithms was a talking point in the class at that point. We wanted to make our own rooms
							so for that I also needed to make a room editor and saving system.
