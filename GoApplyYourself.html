						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						Go Apply Yourself was created in a team of four for the HVA with the assignment of making a
						bullet hell or bullet heaven. As a team we decided on taking inspiration from "enter the
						gungeon" and so we decided to make a roguelike dungeon crawler.
						<h2>My focus for this project</h2>
						<p>
							In the team I became responsible for creating the roguelike dungeon. I created a level
							generation based on rooms. The difficulty came in that we agreed that evenly spaced square
							rooms were boring. So I had to create a system that could handle rooms with variable size,
							shape and door positions. I started this design off with creating a
							<a href="Images/LevelGeneration-UML.png" style="color: blueviolet" target="_blank"
								><u>UML</u></a
							>
							for the whole system. The sideQuest missions were scrapped but the rest was implemented
							following the UML.
						</p>
						<p>
							for this project I choose to make a complicated wall
							<a
								href="https://github.com/kikje5/Go-Apply-Yourself/blob/main/game/LevelGeneration/WallColliderGenerator.cs"
								target="_blank"
								>hitbox optimization algorithm</a
							>
							instead of checking surrounding tiles to set an algorithmic challenge for myself since
							algorithms was a talking point in the class at that point. It optimizes the space that the
							colliders take up, so instead of saving for each tile if it is a wall with a collider, is
							generates filling rectangles for which only 4 variables have to be saved. The bigger the
							area which is filled with walls, the more efficient this algorithm becomes.
						</p>
						<p>
							We wanted to design and make our own rooms so for that I also needed to make a room editor
							and saving system. For this i created a separate
							<a
								href="https://github.com/kikje5/Go-Apply-Yourself/blob/main/game/LevelGeneration/RoomSaver.cs"
								target="_blank"
								>room saver</a
							>
							class which handles all the saving. It makes use of a DataContractSerializer which saves and
							loads the rooms. It however was not possible to make the texture2D serializable so i had to
							separately save the object and the texture. The object gets saved as an xml object and the
							texture gets saved as a png, which on load get recombined to a single room object.
						</p>

						<p>
							Now that i had rooms, they had to be combined, i did this in a separate
							<a
								href="https://github.com/kikje5/Go-Apply-Yourself/blob/main/game/LevelGeneration/LevelBuilder.cs"
								target="_blank"
								>level builder</a
							>
							class. Following the way we designed our level, it first adds the starting room, then a
							couple of primary rooms which end in the end room. Then it adds secondary rooms to fill up
							the level and make interesting side ways instead of a linear path. This way of generating a
							level makes sure that there is always a path of a certain length to the end room, but also
							makes the level interesting. If we added the side-quests these would also be relatively easy
							to add to levels, by adding a new generating step after the secondary rooms where the
							side-quest rooms are added.
