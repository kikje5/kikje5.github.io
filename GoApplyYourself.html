						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						Go Apply Yourself was created in a team of four for the HVA with the assignment of making a
						bullet hell or bullet heaven. As a team we decided on taking inspiration from "enter the
						gungeon" and so we decided to make a roguelike dungeon crawler.
						<h2>My focus for this project</h2>
						In the team I became responsible for creating the roguelike dungeon. I created a level
						generation based on rooms. The difficulty came in that we agreed that evenly spaced square rooms
						were boring. So I had to create a system that could handle rooms with variable size, shape and
						door positions. I started this design off with creating a
						<a href="Images/LevelGeneration-UML.png" style="color: blueviolet" target="_blank"
							><u>UML</u></a
						>
						for the whole system. The sideQuest missions were scrapped but the rest was implemented
						following the UML. I decided to make a complicated wall hitbox optimization algorithm instead of
						checking surrounding tiles to set an algorithmic challenge for myself since algorithms was a
						talking point in the class at that point. We wanted to make our own rooms so for that I also
						needed to make a room editor and saving system.
