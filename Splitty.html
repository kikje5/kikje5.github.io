						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						Splitty is a money splitting app for simplifying paying back the money you owe. It was created
						as an assignment for the TU delft with a team of six in java using spring boot.
						<h2>My focus for this project</h2>
						<p>
							A big part of my work for this project was to design and implement the API. The requirements
							for the project were that we used websockets and long-polling for this to enable the client
							to update when another client made a change. The first step we took as a team was to
							brainstorm the requirements for the API. Following this brainstorm I created a markdown
							document which described the requirements of the API. Having these requirements I researched
							on how to make and made a connection between the client and server using spring boot's REST
							controller and Jakarta's websockets.
						</p>
						<p>
							besides the API i also worked on the frontend. I mostly worked on the UX. After the app
							requirements were set we decided on which pages were necessary to meet these requirements. I
							then created a flowchart to document how these pages would interact with each other. To aid
							in this besides this i also created a wireframe for the main page which could switch to a
							lot of screens. I did this to make sure that it was possible and realistic for this page to
							have so many different buttons which switch to other pages. This was not the wireframe we
							used later but was helpful in deciding the page flow of the application.
