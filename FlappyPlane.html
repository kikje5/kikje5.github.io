						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						Flappy Plane is a game I made for the HVA with the assignment of making a 3D game in Unity
						inspired by Flappy Bird. We were given some guidelines for what was minimally required but we
						had full creative control beside that. Instead of having an animated bird for example, i chose
						for a paper plane, All other creative decisions flowed from this idea, the jump got a wind
						effect, the animation became pitch and roll of the plane.
						<h2>My focus for this project</h2>
						The project requirements were quite bare so i decided to set my goal on making a complete game
						with a reason to play and settings. For this I created a skin system to incentivize the players
						to play more and a settings plage to control the volume. For the technical aspects i focused on
						learning new Unity systems, i picked up the use of scriptable objects, the UI Toolkit and the
						particle system.
