						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						The Theme of the GMTK 2024 Gamejam was "Built to scale". My first idea was a factory game where
						you could make modules of with input and output that could shrink to be reused in other parts of
						the factory, this was partly inspired by the minecraft mod "compact machines". This however was
						and still seems not doable to create in 4 days. I thus opted for a simpler factory puzzle game
						where you create molecules out of atoms.
						<h2>My focus for this project</h2>
						This was my first attempt at a more complicated and original game where I put into practice the
						things i leaned at the TU delft. I now realize that there is a lot I should have done
						differently, but I was and still am proud of what i accomplished in those 4 days. I am most
						proud of the design of the puzzles, this is something i put quite some thought in and I am very
						happy with their difficulty. I also added a typewriter effect to the text, which i feel adds a
						nice touch to the feeling of the game.
