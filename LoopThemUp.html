						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						The theme of the GMTK 2025 gamejam was "Loop". This gave me the idea of needing to make a loop
						of a trailing rope to do damage. This directed me to a cowboy like theme, which gave me the idea
						to add a lasso. This resulted in this simple survival game.
						<h2>My focus for this project</h2>
						I had a lot more idea's for this game but i didn't have the time to implement them. The main
						attack of this game was the rope which dragged behind you and this became the main focus, at the
						end of the project I got some compliments on how smooth it flowed behind the player, so i would
						say that implementing the rope was a success.
